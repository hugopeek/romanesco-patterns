/**
 * listIncludedChunks
 *
 * This snippet is intended to list the chunks that are being used
 * inside another chunk. It needs the raw content of the chunk as input.
 * A regular chunk call won't work, since the referenced chunks have
 * already been parsed there.
 *
 * You can get the raw input by looking directly in the database table
 * of the chunk, using Rowboat for example:
 *
 * [[!Rowboat:toPlaceholder=`rawChunk`?
 *     &table=`modx_site_htmlsnippets`
 *     &tpl=`displayRawElement`
 *     &where=`{"name":"overviewRowBasic"}`
 * ]]
 *
 * Then scan the raw input for included chunks like this:
 *
 * [[!listIncludedChunks? &input=`[[+rawChunk]]`]]
 *
 * If you want to see which chunks have references to a specific chunk
 * (the reverse thing, basically), you can use Rowboat again:
 *
 * [[Rowboat?
 *     &table=`modx_site_htmlsnippets`
 *     &tpl=`listIncludedElementsRow`
 *     &sortBy=`name`
 *     &where=`{ "snippet:LIKE":"%$buttonHrefOverview%" }`
 * ]]
 *
 * This is not entirely accurate though, since a reference to a chunk
 * called something like 'buttonHrefOverviewBasic' will also be listed
 * in the results.
